### OBJECTIVE
I am Onkar Eknath Shelar, a fervent Machine Learning aficionado, currently advancing my expertise through a Master of Science in Data Science at the Rochester Institute of Technology, anticipating completion in May 2025, having a GPA of 4.00/4.00. My scholastic voyage includes a Post-Graduate Diploma in Big Data Analytics from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, India, achieving a GPA of 3.91/4.00, and a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, India, with a GPA of 3.21/4.00.

My academic tapestry is rich and varied, encompassing key domains such as Software Engineering, Database Architecture, Data Science Fundamentals, Analytics, Linux Shell Scripting, Cloud Infrastructure, Advanced Predictive Modeling, Statistical Computing, Python and R scripting, Data Acquisition and Database Management Systems, Big Data Ecosystems, Data Visualization techniques, and Java Object-Oriented Design.

I am proficient in a suite of programming languages, including Python, SQL, Apache Spark, and Java. My toolkit extends to data platforms and services like Git, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Synapse, and Azure Logic App. My capabilities in data strategy and analytics include Data Cleaning and Transformation, Data Architecture, Database Management, Statistical Inference, and Visual Analytics with Power BI. Furthermore, I am adept in Machine Learning methodologies, engaging with Data Mining, Predictive and Descriptive Analytics, Model Tuning, and Advanced Algorithms.

Professionally, I contributed as an Associate Data Engineer at Fractal Analytics (May 2022 â€“ May 2023), spearheading comprehensive data pipeline projects, enhancing data integration, and refining data flow operations. Before this, I served as a Production Coordinator at Sandeep Plastic Industries (July 2018 - March 2020), where I excelled in production planning, team development, and process enhancement. My industry exposure began with a Mechanical Engineering Internship at Sun-Axis Industries (July 2017 - June 2018), overseeing production timelines and managing project deliverables.

My technical proficiency is endorsed by certifications like Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate, Power BI Data Analyst Associate, and Azure Data Fundamentals, among others. I have engaged in substantial projects such as 'Building Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch', 'Analyzing Job Posting Authenticity', and 'Deriving Business Insights from Post-COVID Taxi Services', showcasing my capacity to engineer ML algorithms, construct authenticity models for job listings, and dissect business tactics for post-pandemic urban mobility solutions.

As I seek a Summer 2024 Co-op/Internship, I am eager to employ my advanced analytical skills and machine learning acumen in crafting innovative AI strategies and solutions.
