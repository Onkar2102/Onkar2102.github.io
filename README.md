# PortfolioWorkshop
Sudo code for COMS portfolio workshop

This project was created to teach people how to create 
a portfolio. The current layout and design is structured for
Game Design and Development students, but it can be configured for
personal use. 

Most of the style sheets are already implemented along with the scripts. Placeholder images
and text can be replaced for your customization.
