            <p>
                I am <strong>Onkar</strong>, a fervent Machine Learning aficionado, currently advancing my expertise
                through a <strong>Master of
                    Science in Data Science</strong> at the Rochester Institute of Technology, anticipating completion
                in May 2025,
                having a GPA of <strong>4.00/4.00</strong>. My scholastic voyage includes a <strong>Post-Graduate
                    Diploma in Big Data Analytics</strong>
                from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, India, achieving a GPA of
                <strong>3.91/4.00</strong>, and a
                <strong>Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering</strong> from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, India,
                with a GPA of <strong>3.21/4.00</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic tapestry is rich and varied, encompassing key domains such as Software Engineering, Database
                Architecture, Data Science Fundamentals, Analytics, Linux Shell Scripting, Cloud Infrastructure,
                Advanced Predictive Modeling, Statistical Computing, Python and R scripting, Data Acquisition and
                Database Management Systems, Big Data Ecosystems, Data Visualization techniques, and Java
                Object-Oriented Design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am proficient in a suite of programming languages, including Python, SQL, Apache Spark, and Java. My
                toolkit extends to data platforms and services like Git, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Factory, Azure
                Data Lake Storage, Azure Synapse, and Azure Logic App. My capabilities in data strategy and analytics
                include Data Cleaning and Transformation, Data Architecture, Database Management, Statistical Inference,
                and Visual Analytics with Power BI. Furthermore, I am adept in Machine Learning methodologies, engaging
                with Data Mining, Predictive and Descriptive Analytics, Model Tuning, and Advanced Algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I contributed as an Associate Data Engineer at Fractal Analytics (May 2022 â€“ May 2023),
                spearheading comprehensive data pipeline projects, enhancing data integration, and refining data flow
                operations. Before this, I served as a Production Coordinator at Sandeep Plastic Industries (July 2018 -
                March
                2020), where I excelled in production planning, team development, and process enhancement. My industry
                exposure began
                with a Mechanical Engineering Internship at Sun-Axis Industries (July 2017 - June 2018), overseeing
                production
                timelines and managing project deliverables.
            </p>
            <p>
                My technical proficiency is endorsed by certifications like Microsoft Certified: <strong>Azure Data
                Engineer Associate</strong>, <strong>Power BI Data Analyst Associate</strong>, <strong>Azure Data
                Fundamentals</strong>, and <strong>Azure Fundamentals</strong> among others. I have engaged in
                substantial projects such as 'Building Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch', 'Analyzing Job Posting
                Authenticity', and 'Deriving Business Insights from Post-COVID Taxi Services', showcasing my capacity to
                engineer ML algorithms, construct authenticity models for job listings, and dissect business tactics for
                post-pandemic urban mobility solutions.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                As I seek a Summer 2024 Co-op/Internship, I am eager to employ my advanced analytical skills and machine
                learning acumen in crafting innovative AI strategies and solutions.
